## Source information
The source code is built on top of the "Pools" source provided with Alexander Blade's ScriptHookSDK. I'm using that same Project name because I may work on multiple mods at the same time so reloading scripts is easier and safer because there is only one mod installed during that specific game session. Therefore, the compiled .asi file is named Pools.asi. The file can be renamed later. 
##### The keyboard library is no longer required in the latest version. The built-in UI prompts are used instead.

## Installation
#### Requirements: [Alexander Blade's ScriptHookRDR2](http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/)
- Copy "Pools.asi" file under /samples/Pools/bin/Release/ directory to your Red Dead Redemption 2 game folder.
- Done!
